## Hello there! 

I'm Yuhan, a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, studying [Digital Media Design](http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html) (computer graphics / computer science) in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. 

For more information about me, visit my personal website at [liuyuhan.me](https://liuyuhan.me/). 
For questions and inquiries, message me at *yuhanl@seas.upenn.edu*.

## [GPU Cuda Path Tracer](https://github.com/yuhanliu-tech/GPU-CUDA-Path-Tracer)

<img src="https://github.com/yuhanliu-tech/GPU-CUDA-Path-Tracer/blob/main/img/cover.png" width="300"/> 

CUDA-based path tracer to render globally-illuminated scenes. Performance optimizations, proceduralism, mesh & textures, denoising and antialiasing.

## [WebGPU Forward+ & Clustered-Deferred Renderer](https://github.com/yuhanliu-tech/WebGPU-Forward-Plus-and-Clustered-Deferred)

<img src="https://github.com/yuhanliu-tech/WebGPU-Forward-Plus-and-Clustered-Deferred/blob/main/img/cover.png" width="300"/> 

Forward+ Shading and Clustered Deferred Shading, using WebGPU and TypeScript, demonstrated on Sponza atrium model with hundreds of point lights. Additional aesthetic artistic cell and outline fragment shader.
[Live Demo](https://yuhanliu-tech.github.io/WebGPU-Forward-Plus-and-Clustered-Deferred/) available on Chrome. 

## [WebGL Wisp Shader](https://github.com/yuhanliu-tech/will-o-wisp-shader)

<img src="https://github.com/yuhanliu-tech/will-o-wisp-shader/blob/master/wisp.png" width="300"/> 

Inspired by the Will-o'-the-Wisps from Brave, I created my own wisp using procedural noise tools in WebGL and TypeScript.
[Live Demo](https://yuhanliu-tech.github.io/will-o-wisp-shader/) available in browser.
